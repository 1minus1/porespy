# PoreSpy Examples

This folder contains examples of how to use PoreSpy for a variety of common
task.  They are categorized by folder, corresponding to the location of the
function in the package.  For instance, /filters/porosimetry.ipynb explains
how to use the porosimetry filter.

Note: PoreSpy used to maintain a separate examples repo on Github, but we
found that these examples would often be out of date with the latest version
of the package and not work.  To remedy this, we've moved the examples into
the main repo, so that when breaking changes are made, we'll be notified
that the examples no longer work since they are tested along with the rest
of the package (thanks TravisCI!).
